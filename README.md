# üñ•Ô∏è Opening the Project on your Local System

Once the project has been cloned and you have all the necessary items on your local computer, open the project in the application of your choice ([Visual Code Studio](https://code.visualstudio.com/) was used and is recommended by the application builder)

### Run the project:

1. In the terminal type `npm install` to install the JSON package
2. Run `npm start` to view the site in a browser.
3. The Expo developer tools will open in a browser, if they do not press `d` to open the Metro bundler.
4. Once the Metro bundler is opened you can use the options on the left to open on either your [XCode](https://docs.expo.io/workflow/ios-simulator/) iPhone simulator or your [Andriod Emulator](https://docs.expo.io/workflow/android-studio-emulator/) or scan the QR code to open using the Expo Go app.
   - Note: There is also the option to open this app in your browser using the Metro bundler, however, some of the functions of the app will not be available as it was built to be used on a mobile device.
5. Sign in and get a friend to create an account as well!
